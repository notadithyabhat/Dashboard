## Overview
Welcome to the Equipment Allocation Dashboard! This platform helps you maximize the usage of equipment across different program types efficiently. 

### Key Highlights:
- **Purpose**: Optimize equipment allocation to enhance resource utilization.
- **Constraints**:
    - Each piece of equipment is assigned to one program.
    - Program and equipment capacities are respected.

üîç Dive into the data and optimization results below!
